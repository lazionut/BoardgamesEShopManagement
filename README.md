# Boardgames EShop Management

A web API developed during an internship with endpoints to register, login and manage accounts, buy, review, wishlist and manage boardgames built with .NET 6, SQL Server, Entity Framework ORM, MediatR, AutoMapper, Microsoft Identity and Azure Storage Blobs.

### Notes

Blob Storage is no longer working due to account trial. <br />
The same reason applies to not using KeyVault, the focus wasn't on the cloud.
